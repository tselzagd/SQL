1. Top 20 Buyers Information: Generate a list of the top 20 buyers in terms of total purchase value. 
Include details such as the buyer's name, contact information, and the total amount they've spent.

SELECT TOP 20
    first_name,
    last_name,
	phone,
    email,
    SUM(items.quantity * (items.list_price - (items.list_price * items.discount))) AS total_purchase_value
FROM
    sales.customers cust
JOIN
    sales.orders o ON cust.customer_id = o.customer_id
JOIN
    sales.order_items items ON o.order_id = items.order_id
GROUP BY
    first_name, last_name, phone, email
ORDER BY
    total_purchase_value DESC;

2. Location Sales Visualization: Create a geographical visualization of buyer locations. 
Use color coding to differentiate between locations with the highest sales performance (top locations) and 
those with poor sales performance (bad sales locations). 
You can use a map or another suitable chart for this purpose.

select cus.city, cus.zip_code, SUM(item.quantity*(item.list_price*(1-item.discount))) as sales 
from sales.customers as cus
join sales.orders as ord on cus.customer_id = ord.customer_id
join sales.order_items as item on ord.order_id = item.order_id
group by cus.city, cus.zip_code
order by sales desc;

3. Yearly Sales Analysis: Analyze the sales data to determine which year had the highest overall sales. 
Include information on the total sales for each year in your report.

SELECT year (ord.order_date) as Year ,
sum(([list_price] - (list_price * [discount])) * quantity) as total_sales
FROM [sales].[order_items] as it
left join [sales].[orders] as ord on it.order_id = ord.order_id
group by year (ord.order_date)
order by 2 desc;

4. Product Sales Analysis: Identify which product was the top-selling product across all years. 
Include details on the product name and its total sales.

select sum(ord_it.quantity*ord_it.list_price*(1-discount)) as total_sales,
prod.product_name
from production.products as prod
join sales.order_items as ord_it on prod.product_id=ord_it.product_id
group by prod.product_name
order by 1 desc;

5. Best Month for Product Sales: Determine which month was the best-performing for each product. 
Provide a breakdown of the top-selling month for each product, along with the sales figures.

WITH top_selling_month AS (
    SELECT
        pr.product_name,
        MONTH(ord.order_date) AS sales_month,
        YEAR(ord.order_date) AS sales_year,
        SUM(it.list_price * it.quantity * (1 - it.discount)) AS total_sales,
        DENSE_RANK() OVER (PARTITION BY pr.product_name ORDER BY SUM(it.list_price * it.quantity * (1 - it.discount)) DESC) AS rank
    FROM
        production.products AS pr
    JOIN
        sales.order_items AS it ON pr.product_id = it.product_id
    JOIN
        sales.orders AS ord ON ord.order_id = it.order_id
    GROUP BY
        pr.product_name, MONTH(ord.order_date), YEAR(ord.order_date)
)
SELECT TOP 10
    product_name,
    DATENAME(MONTH, DATEADD(MONTH, sales_month - 1, 0)) + ' ' + CAST(sales_year AS VARCHAR(4)) AS sales_month_year,
    total_sales
FROM
    top_selling_month
WHERE
    rank = 1
ORDER BY
    total_sales DESC;
