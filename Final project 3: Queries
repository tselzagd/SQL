--- OVERVIEW: The project aimed to analyze COVID-19 patient data comprehensively, focusing on gender distribution, age group analysis, pregnant patients, and 
specific medical conditions. It began with data cleaning and mapping in Excel, followed by SQL queries to extract insights. 
The goal was to generate reports, flat files, and interactive Tableau dashboards for informed decision-making regarding COVID-19 patient management 
and healthcare strategies. ----

	• Count of Patients by Gender: Categorize patients by gender (male, female, other).

	• Count of Patients by Age Group and COVID-19 Deaths: Analyze the count of patients in each age group who
